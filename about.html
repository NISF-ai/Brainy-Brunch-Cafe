         <h2>    We began our adventure of creating a new sort of cafe long before a virus made everyone a homebody, social-distancing a familiar phrase. Imagine a place with casual & cozy environment for people enjoying their coffee from freshly roasted and ground premium coffee beans giving them a delightful experience.

        Brainy Brunch owns two locations in Hyderabad City (both loved by the people of Hyderabad). They serve inventive coffee drinks and fresh cookies & pastries.


This café website nails the vibe quotient a coffee shop website demands. It does so by showcasing natural pictures of their coffee, the people making it, and the people enjoying it with friends. The beige background color just adds to it.
